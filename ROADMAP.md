# 🚀 EvolveX System: Future Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic development plan for the EvolveX System, transforming it from a gamified dashboard into a full-fledged "Solo Leveling" life-RPG.

## Phase 1: The "Dungeon" System (Advanced Productivity)
**Goal:** deeply engage users in deep-work sessions.
*   **Concept**: Transformation of large projects or study sessions into "Dungeons".
*   **Mechanics**:
    *   **Timed Modes**: "Enter Dungeon" starts a Pomodoro-style timer (e.g., 50 mins).
    *   **Boss Fights**: A massive task (e.g., "Complete Final Report") broken into sub-tasks (HP bars). Completing sub-tasks damages the boss.
    *   **Risk/Reward**: Failing to complete in time deals "damage" to user HP. Success grants massive EXP and rare "Drops".

## Phase 2: Economy & Inventory
**Goal:** Provide tangible rewards for productivity.
*   **Currency**: Introduce **Gold** earned alongside EXP.
*   **The Shop**:
    *   **Real Rewards**: Users can configure custom rewards (e.g., "1 Hour Gaming" = 500 Gold).
    *   **Consumables**: "Potions" (Restore Stamina), "XP Boosters" (2x EXP for 1 hour).
*   **Inventory**:
    *   **Equipment**: Collect "Items" (e.g., "Keyboard of Swiftness") that provide passive stat buffs (e.g., +5 Agility).

## Phase 3: Social "Guilds"
**Goal:** Community motivation.
*   **Leaderboards**: Weekly ranking based on EXP gained.
*   **Guilds/Parties**: Link with friends.
    *   **Party Buffs**: If a party member completes a quest, everyone gets a small buff.
    *   **Raid Quests**: Collaborative goals (e.g., "Party must code 20 hours total this week").

## Phase 4: Analytics "System Window"
**Goal:** Long-term excitement and tracking.
*   **Visual Charts**: Graphs showing productivity trends over weeks/months.
*   **Streak Tracking**: "Daily Quest" streaks with increasing rewards (1.5x EXP for 7-day streak).
*   **Class Change**: At Level 20, choose a class (e.g., "Shadow Monarch", "Ruler", "Monarch of Destruction") which unlocks exclusive skills.

## Phase 5: Mobile Experience
**Goal:** Accessibility everywhere.
*   **PWA Features**: Installable on mobile phones.
*   **Widgets**: Home screen widget for current Quests and Stamina.
*   **Push Notifications**: "Your energy has fully recovered."
